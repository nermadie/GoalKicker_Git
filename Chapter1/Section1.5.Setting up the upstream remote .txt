SECTION 1.5:

If you have cloned a fork you may not have push access to the upstream repo, so you need both your fork but be able to fetch the upstream repo
Check remote name:
	+ git remote -v
	origin https://github.com/myusername/repo.git (fetch)
	origin https://github.com/myusername/repo.git (push)
	upstream # this line may or may not be here

Nếu upstream đã có sẵn (Ở 1 số git versions) thì ta set the URL (currently ít's empty):
	git remote set-url upstream https://github.com/projectusername/repo.git

Nếu chưa có upstream, hoặc nếu bạn muốn add một fork (currently they do not exist):
	git remote add upstream https://github.com/projectusername/repo.git
	git remote add dave https://github.com/dave/repo.git

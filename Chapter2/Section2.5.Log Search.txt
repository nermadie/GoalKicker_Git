SECTION 2.5:

Để tìm kiếm trong git (tìm kiếm diff - những thay đổi đã lưu lại). Sử dụng:
	+Đối với "addition" / "removal" của 1 string mà matching vs string được đưa vào:
		git log -S"string"
		VD: git log -S"#define SAMPLES"
	+Đối với changes của 1 line chứa string được đưa vào:
		git log -G"string"
		VD: git log -G"string"
		

Reference in git-scm:
-S<string>
Look for differences that change the number of occurrences of the specified string (i.e. addition/deletion) in a file. Intended for the scripter’s use.

It is useful when you’re looking for an exact block of code (like a struct), and want to know the history of that block since it first came into being: use the feature iteratively to feed the interesting block in the preimage back into -S, and keep going until you get the very first version of the block.

Binary files are searched as well.

-G<regex>
Look for differences whose patch text contains added/removed lines that match <regex>.

To illustrate the difference between -S<regex> --pickaxe-regex and -G<regex>, consider a commit with the following diff in the same file:

+    return frotz(nitfol, two->ptr, 1, 0);
...
-    hit = frotz(nitfol, mf2.ptr, 1, 0);
While git log -G"frotz\(nitfol" will show this commit, git log -S"frotz\(nitfol" --pickaxe-regex will not (because the number of occurrences of that string did not change).

Unless --text is supplied patches of binary files without a textconv filter will be ignored.

See the pickaxe entry in gitdiffcore[7] for more information.
